# COMP331 Final Project – Data Mining Quality & Bias Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the final project for **COMP331**, focusing on **data mining quality and bias analysis**.  
The chosen dataset is the **Adult Income dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)**, which includes demographic attributes and an income label (`<=50K` or `>50K`).  

The project evaluates three key data quality dimensions:
- **Completeness** → Missing values in attributes such as workclass, occupation, and native-country.  
- **Validity** → Range and category checks for numeric and categorical fields.  
- **Bias/Fairness** → Sampling bias across sex and race groups, highlighting fairness concerns.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **/data** → Dataset files (`adult.data`, `adult.test`, `adult.names`).  
- **/scripts** → Python script (`analysis.py`) containing all checks (completeness, validity, bias/fairness).  
- **/results** → Outputs generated by the script (CSV summaries, plots).  
- **README.md** → Project documentation.  

---

1. Install dependencies:
    pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib


2. Run the analysis:
     python scripts/analysis.py
   

Check outputs in the /results folder:

  missing_summary.csv → Completeness evidence
  
  income_by_sex.png → Bias/fairness visualization by sex
  
  income_by_race.png → Bias/fairness visualization by race
  
  Other CSVs and plots as generated  


Results Summary
  Completeness: Missing values detected in workclass, occupation, and native-country.
  
  Validity: No invalid ranges or categories found → strong schema adherence.
  
  Uniqueness: No duplicate records detected.
  
  Bias/Fairness: Clear imbalance in income distribution across sex and race groups.
