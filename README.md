# COMP331 Final Project – Data Mining Quality & Bias Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the final project for **COMP331**, focusing on **data mining quality and bias analysis**.  
The chosen dataset is the **Adult Income dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)**, which includes demographic attributes and an income label (`<=50K` or `>50K`).  

The project evaluates three key data quality dimensions:
- **Completeness** → Missing values in attributes such as workclass, occupation, and native-country.  
- **Validity** → Range and category checks for numeric and categorical fields.  
- **Bias/Fairness** → Sampling bias across sex and race groups, highlighting fairness concerns.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **/data** → Dataset files (`adult.data`, `adult.test`, `adult.names`).  
- **/scripts** → Python script (`analysis.py`) containing all checks (completeness, validity, bias/fairness).  
- **/results** → Outputs generated by the script (CSV summaries, plots).  
- **README.md** → Project documentation.  

---

First install:
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib

Then: 
python scripts/analysis.py

Check outputs in the /results folder:

missing_summary.csv → Completeness evidence.

income_by_sex.png → Bias/fairness visualization by sex. 


Results Summary: 
Completeness: Missing values detected in workclass, occupation, and native-country.

Validity: No invalid ranges or categories found → strong schema adherence.

Uniqueness: No duplicate records detected.

Bias/Fairness: Clear imbalance in income distribution across sex and race groups.



Dataset Information: 
Source: UCI Adult Dataset

Instances: ~48,842 rows

Attributes: 14 features + income label

Common uses: Fairness and bias analysis in machine learning models. 


AI Tool Use Disclosure
Copilot was used to assist with:

Writing Python code for data quality checks.

Generating plots for bias/fairness analysis.

Structuring this README file.

All outputs were verified and documented manually to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.
